# Subscription System Fix

## Problem

The subscription system was incorrectly requiring all users to have active subscriptions, even though they should all have free accounts. This was causing users to see the "Subscription Required" screen even though they should have access.

## Root Cause

The system has an environment variable `SUBSCRIPTION_ENFORCE` set to `false` in the `.env` file, but the code wasn't properly checking this value. The subscription system was enforcing subscription requirements regardless of this setting.

## Solution

Updated the subscription model code to respect the `SUBSCRIPTION_ENFORCE` environment variable:

1. Modified `check_user_subscription_access()` function to check the `SUBSCRIPTION_ENFORCE` environment variable and return `true` when it's set to `false`
2. Modified `check_subscription_status()` function to do the same check

These changes ensure that when `SUBSCRIPTION_ENFORCE=false` in the environment, all subscription checks will pass regardless of actual subscription status. This allows all users to have access to the application without requiring an active subscription.

## Implementation Details

The following changes were made to `/mnt/d/smart_meal_planner_multi/apps/smart-meal-planner-backend/app/models/subscription.py`:

1. Added environment variable check in `check_user_subscription_access()`:
```python
# Check if subscription enforcement is disabled via environment variable
import os
subscription_enforce = os.getenv("SUBSCRIPTION_ENFORCE", "false").lower() == "true"

if not subscription_enforce:
    # If subscription enforcement is disabled, all users have access
    logger.info(f"Subscription enforcement disabled (SUBSCRIPTION_ENFORCE=false) - granting access to user {user_id}")
    return True
```

2. Added the same check in `check_subscription_status()`:
```python
# Check if subscription enforcement is disabled via environment variable
import os
subscription_enforce = os.getenv("SUBSCRIPTION_ENFORCE", "false").lower() == "true"

if not subscription_enforce:
    # If subscription enforcement is disabled, all subscriptions are considered active
    logger.info(f"Subscription enforcement disabled (SUBSCRIPTION_ENFORCE=false) - all subscriptions considered active")
    return True
```

## Configuration

The `.env` file already has the correct configuration:
```
SUBSCRIPTION_ENFORCE=false
```

This setting should be kept as `false` for all environments where you want all users to have free access.

## Testing

To test this fix:
1. Ensure the `.env` file has `SUBSCRIPTION_ENFORCE=false`
2. Restart the backend server
3. Attempt to access the application with any account - all accounts should have access
4. Check server logs for messages indicating "Subscription enforcement disabled"

If you want to enable subscription enforcement in the future:
1. Set `SUBSCRIPTION_ENFORCE=true` in your `.env` file
2. Restart the backend server

## Notes

- No frontend changes were required for this fix
- The existing subscription system remains intact and will work properly if you enable enforcement in the future
- Users won't notice any difference other than now having access to all features
- You can still track which users have subscriptions in the database, the system just won't enforce access restrictions
