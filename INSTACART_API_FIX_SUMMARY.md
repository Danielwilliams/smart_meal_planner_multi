# Instacart API Integration Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

1. **URL Path Prefix Mismatch**
   - The frontend was sending requests to `/api/instacart/...` routes
   - But the backend was using `/instacart/...` routes
   - We've updated all frontend calls to use the correct routes without the `/api` prefix

2. **API Key Format**
   - The Instacart API requires an API key with the format `InstacartAPI YOUR_KEY`
   - We've made sure the backend formats the key correctly

## Files Changed

1. **Frontend**
   - `src/services/instacartBackendService.js` - Updated all API endpoints
   - `src/components/InstacartSimpleTester.jsx` - Updated API endpoint paths

## Environment Variable Setup

The `INSTACARTAPI_DEV` environment variable must be set on your Railway server with the correct format:

```
INSTACARTAPI_DEV=InstacartAPI YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
```

## Testing Your Changes

After pushing these changes, the Instacart integration should work correctly. Remember to:

1. Set the environment variable on Railway
2. Confirm the key has the correct format with the "InstacartAPI " prefix
3. Test the integration from your frontend

If issues persist, you can add more detailed logging to help diagnose the problem:

```python
# In the instacart.py file
logger.info(f"Using API key (first 4 chars): {api_key[:4]}")
logger.info(f"Headers being sent: {self.session.headers}")
```

## Key Observations

The main difference between Kroger and Instacart implementations was the URL structure:

- Kroger frontend uses `/kroger/...` routes
- Instacart frontend was using `/api/instacart/...` routes
- The backend consistently uses the same format (`/service/...`) for all services

We've aligned the Instacart calls to match the backend's expected format.
