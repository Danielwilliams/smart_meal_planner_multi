# Instacart API Integration Fix

## Overview
This document explains the changes made to fix the Instacart API integration. The primary issues were:

1. Using an outdated API endpoint structure
2. Incorrect headers for API authentication
3. Lack of support for retrieving nearby retailers

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated API Base URL and Version
```python
# Old
BASE_URL = "https://connect.instacart.com"
API_VERSION = "v2022-09-01"

# New
BASE_URL = "https://platform-api.instacart.com"
API_VERSION = "v1"
```

The original code was using the Instacart Connect API, which is only available to retailers. We've switched to using the Instacart Developer Platform API, which was launched in March 2024 and is intended for third-party developers.

### 2. Updated API Authentication Header
```python
# Old
self.session.headers.update({
    "Instacart-Connect-Api-Key": self.formatted_api_key,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json"
})

# New
self.session.headers.update({
    "X-Instacart-API-Key": self.formatted_api_key,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json"
})
```

The Developer Platform API uses a different header format for API keys.

### 3. Updated API Key Formatting
The old code expected the API key to be prefixed with "InstacartAPI ". The new code removes this prefix if present:

```python
# Old
if not self.api_key.startswith("InstacartAPI "):
    logger.info("Adding 'InstacartAPI' prefix to key")
    self.formatted_api_key = f"InstacartAPI {self.api_key}"
else:
    logger.info("API key already has 'InstacartAPI' prefix")
    self.formatted_api_key = self.api_key

# New
self.formatted_api_key = self.api_key
if self.api_key.startswith("InstacartAPI "):
    logger.info("Removing 'InstacartAPI' prefix from key for Developer Platform API")
    self.formatted_api_key = self.api_key.replace("InstacartAPI ", "")
```

### 4. Updated API Endpoint Paths
```python
# Old
response = self._make_request("GET", "retailers")

# New
response = self._make_request("GET", "retailers/list")
```

```python
# Old
endpoint = f"retailers/{retailer_id}/products/search"

# New
endpoint = f"retailers/{retailer_id}/products"
```

The new Developer Platform API uses different endpoint paths for accessing retailers and products.

### 5. Added Support for Nearby Retailers
Added a new method to get retailers near a specified ZIP code:

```python
def get_nearby_retailers(self, zip_code: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Get retailers near a specific ZIP code.
    
    Args:
        zip_code: The ZIP code to search near
        
    Returns:
        List of nearby retailer objects
    """
    params = {
        "zip_code": zip_code
    }
    
    endpoint = "retailers/nearby"
    response = self._make_request("GET", endpoint, params=params)
    
    return response.get("data", [])
```

### 6. Updated `/retailers/nearby` Endpoint
Completely rewrote the `/retailers/nearby` endpoint to use the new `get_nearby_retailers` method:

```python
@router.get("/retailers/nearby", response_model=None)
async def get_nearby_instacart_retailers(
    zip_code: str = Query(..., description="ZIP code to find nearby retailers"),
    current_user: dict = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """
    Get a list of Instacart retailers near a specified ZIP code.
    Uses the Instacart Developer Platform API to find nearby retailers.
    """
    # Implementation uses client.get_nearby_retailers() and handles errors
```

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Proper API Integration**: Now using the correct, modern Instacart Developer Platform API
2. **Support for Nearby Retailers**: Added support for location-based filtering of retailers
3. **Better Error Handling**: Maintained consistent error responses
4. **Correct Authentication**: Using the proper header format for API authentication

## Next Steps

1. Update the `INSTACARTAPI_DEV` environment variable to use the new format (without the "InstacartAPI " prefix)
2. Test all Instacart API endpoints with the new implementation
3. Update any frontend code that might be expecting the old response format

## Notes on the Instacart Developer Platform API
The Instacart Developer Platform API was launched in March 2024 as a way for third-party developers to integrate Instacart shopping functionality into their applications. This is a different API from the Instacart Connect API, which is only available to retailers who want to offer Instacart fulfillment on their own e-commerce platforms.

The Developer Platform API has better support for features like finding nearby retailers, which is why we've updated the integration to use this newer API.
