# Shared Menus Fixes Applied

## SQL Errors Fixed

1. **Removed non-existent `permission_level` column** from all queries
   - Changed to use `'read' as permission_level` in SELECT statements
   - Removed `permission_level` from INSERT statements

2. **Removed non-existent `recipe_type` column** from saved_recipes query
   - Fixed the saved recipes query to only select existing columns

3. **Removed non-existent `organization_id` column** from menus table
   - Fixed direct menus query to use NULL for organization_id

## Database Fixes Needed

To fix the missing organization_clients relationship, run this SQL:

```sql
-- Fix organization_clients table to ensure client 26 is properly linked to organization 7
INSERT INTO organization_clients (organization_id, client_id, status, joined_at)
SELECT 7, 26, 'active', NOW()
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM organization_clients 
    WHERE organization_id = 7 AND client_id = 26
);

-- Verify the fix
SELECT * FROM organization_clients WHERE client_id = 26;

-- Also check if user 26 has the correct role
UPDATE users SET role = 'client' WHERE id = 26 AND role IS NULL;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start the backend server** and test the endpoints
2. **Use the debug page** at `/debug/shared-menus` to verify API responses
3. **Check server logs** for the detailed debugging output
4. **Run the SQL fix** if the organization_clients relationship is missing

The shared menus should now display correctly in both the organization and client interfaces once the SQL fix is applied.
