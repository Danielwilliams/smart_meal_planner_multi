# "By Meal" Tab Fix

This document provides a fix for the "Pn.get is not a function" error that occurs when clicking on the "By Meal" tab in the Shopping List page.

## Root Cause

The error occurs when switching to the "By Meal" tab (tab index 2) because:

1. The `MealShoppingList` component makes an API call to `/menu/{menuId}/meal-shopping-lists`
2. This endpoint may not exist or returns data in an unexpected format
3. The error handling in the component doesn't properly handle unexpected responses
4. When an error occurs, the code tries to call `get()` on an object that doesn't have that method

## Fix Implementation

To fix this issue, we need to implement three things:

1. A robust `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and display errors gracefully
2. Improved error handling in the `MealShoppingList` component
3. Implementation of the missing backend endpoint

### Step 1: Add ErrorBoundary Component

Create a new file `src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx` with the provided ErrorBoundary component implementation.

### Step 2: Fix MealShoppingList Component

Replace the content of `src/components/MealShoppingList.jsx` with the fixed version that has improved error handling. The key changes are:

1. Better error catching and handling in the API call
2. Defensive checks before accessing properties
3. Graceful fallbacks when data is missing or in the wrong format

### Step 3: Update ShoppingListPage

Wrap the `MealShoppingList` component with our new `ErrorBoundary` in the ShoppingListPage.jsx file:

1. Import the ErrorBoundary component:
```javascript
import ErrorBoundary from '../components/ErrorBoundary';
```

2. Find the "By Meal" tab panel section and replace it with:
```jsx
{/* By Meal List Tab Panel */}
<div
  role="tabpanel"
  hidden={activeTab !== 2}
  id="tabpanel-2"
  aria-labelledby="tab-2"
>
  {selectedMenuId ? (
    <ErrorBoundary 
      fallback={
        <Alert severity="error" sx={{ my: 2 }}>
          An error occurred loading meal lists. This feature may not be available yet.
        </Alert>
      }
    >
      <MealShoppingList menuId={selectedMenuId} />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  ) : (
    <Alert severity="info">
      Please select a menu to view meal-specific shopping lists
    </Alert>
  )}
</div>
```

### Step 4: Implement Backend Endpoint

Add the missing `/menu/{menu_id}/meal-shopping-lists` endpoint to handle requests for meal-specific shopping lists. This endpoint should:

1. Get the menu by ID
2. Extract meal and ingredient information
3. Format it for the frontend component
4. Return the data in the expected structure

Add the provided endpoint implementation to your menu router in `app/routers/menu.py`.

## Testing

After implementing these changes:

1. Rebuild your frontend application
2. Ensure the backend server is running with the new endpoint
3. Navigate to the Shopping List page
4. Try switching to the "By Meal" tab with different menus

The tab should now either:
- Show the meal shopping lists when data is available
- Show a graceful error message when there's a problem
- Never display the "Pn.get is not a function" error

## Long-term Improvements

For a more robust solution, consider these additional improvements:

1. Add comprehensive unit tests for the MealShoppingList component
2. Implement proper error monitoring to track issues
3. Add a feature toggle to disable the tab if the backend endpoint isn't ready
4. Implement proper API versioning to handle changes in data structure
