# Instacart API Integration Changes

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the Instacart API integration in the Smart Meal Planner application. The primary issue was that the application was attempting to access the Instacart API through a backend proxy, resulting in 500 status code errors. The solution was to modify the application to connect directly to the Instacart Connect API with the proper authorization header format.

## Key Changes

### 1. Direct API Connection

- Updated `instacartAuthService.js` to connect directly to the Instacart Connect API at `https://connect.dev.instacart.tools`
- Implemented proper authorization header format: `Authorization: InstacartAPI YOUR_API_KEY`
- Added robust path detection to try both `/v1` and `/idp/v1` API paths
- Implemented localStorage caching for successful API paths and connections

### 2. Improved Error Handling

- Enhanced error detection and reporting in all API service functions
- Added detailed diagnostic information for common error scenarios (401, 403, 500, etc.)
- Created rich UI error messages with troubleshooting suggestions
- Implemented fallback strategies when API connections fail

### 3. API Diagnostics and Testing

- Updated `InstacartApiTester.jsx` component with comprehensive API testing features
- Created `instacartApiKeyTester.js` to specifically test API key and authorization header formats
- Added visualization of API response formats for easier troubleshooting
- Implemented testing of multiple authentication header formats to determine which works

### 4. CartPage Integration

- Modified `CartPage.jsx` to use direct API methods for Instacart integration
- Enhanced product search functionality to use direct API when available
- Implemented graceful fallbacks when API is not available
- Added improved state management for Instacart retailer selection

### 5. Documentation

- Created test instructions for verifying the Instacart API integration
- Added comprehensive comments to explain authorization requirements
- Documented the API response formats and error handling patterns
- Provided troubleshooting guidelines for common issues

## API Connection Details

### Endpoint URLs

- Main API: `https://connect.dev.instacart.tools/v1`
- Alternate API: `https://connect.dev.instacart.tools/idp/v1`

### Required Headers

```
Authorization: InstacartAPI YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

### Common Endpoints

- Retailers: `/retailers?postal_code=${zipCode}&country_code=US`
- Product Search: `/retailers/${retailerId}/products/search?query=${query}&limit=${limit}`
- Cart Creation: `/retailers/${retailerId}/carts` (POST)

## Testing the Integration

1. Use the `Test Key Format` button in the developer tools to verify your API key works with the correct header format
2. Check the diagnostic output to see which API paths are working
3. Monitor localStorage for connection status and API path information
4. Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests for proper headers

## Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized**: Check that your authorization header format is exactly `Authorization: InstacartAPI YOUR_KEY`
- **403 Forbidden**: Verify your API key has the necessary permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Try both API paths (`/v1` and `/idp/v1`)
- **500 Server Error**: Check request payload formats, especially product IDs
- **Network Error**: Verify you can access `https://connect.dev.instacart.tools` from your network

## Future Improvements

1. Add API key configuration UI to allow easy updates without code changes
2. Implement automated tests for API connectivity
3. Add more robust caching to reduce API calls
4. Enhance product search with fallback matching algorithms when the API is unavailable
