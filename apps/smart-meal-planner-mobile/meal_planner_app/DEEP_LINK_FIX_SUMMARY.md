# Deep Link Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The Flutter app was receiving deep links correctly (as shown in logs: `D/com.llfbandit.app_links(30944): handleIntent: (Data) smartmealplanner://kroger-auth?code=XGUwpRMdXMzuWhXPb5qd3ze4X24u9lt6tIOPwOv7&state=1750892015245`) but the authentication was hanging because the backend API calls were failing due to missing Authorization headers.

## Root Cause
The backend `/kroger/process-code` endpoint requires authentication with `user = Depends(get_user_from_token)`, but the Flutter app was not sending the user's auth token in the Authorization header.

## Fix Applied
Updated the `_completeAuthentication` method in `kroger_auth_screen.dart` to include the Authorization header in all backend API calls:

### Before:
```dart
final response = await http.post(
  url,
  headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
  body: jsonEncode({
    "code": code,
    "redirect_uri": "smartmealplanner://kroger-auth"
  }),
);
```

### After:
```dart
final response = await http.post(
  url,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer ${widget.authToken}",
  },
  body: jsonEncode({
    "code": code,
    "redirect_uri": "smartmealplanner://kroger-auth"
  }),
);
```

## Changes Made
1. **POST /kroger/process-code**: Added Authorization header
2. **GET /kroger/process-code**: Added Authorization header  
3. **POST /kroger/auth-callback**: Added Authorization header

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User clicks "Authenticate with Kroger" in Flutter app
2. App opens external browser with Kroger OAuth URL
3. User completes authentication in browser
4. Browser redirects to `smartmealplanner://kroger-auth?code=...&state=...`
5. Android receives deep link and passes to Flutter via app_links package
6. Flutter `_handleDeepLinkUri` method processes the deep link
7. Flutter extracts auth code and calls backend with proper Authorization header
8. Backend successfully processes auth code and saves real tokens
9. Flutter receives success response and completes authentication
10. User returns to app with successful Kroger connection
