## üß† Analytics Capabilities

### User Preference Extraction
1. **Cuisine Preferences**
   - Top cuisines based on rating patterns
   - Diversity score (willingness to try new cuisines)
   - Preference strength scoring

2. **Cooking Style Analysis**
   - Preferred difficulty level
   - Time preference patterns (quick, medium, long)
   - Cooking engagement metrics

3. **Aspect Importance Ranking**
   - Most important rating aspects (taste, ease, etc.)
   - Consistency scoring
   - Priority weighting for AI recommendations

4. **Ingredient Insights**
   - Frequently liked ingredients from high-rated recipes
   - Ingredients from low-rated recipes (to avoid)
   - Adventure score (willingness to try new ingredients)

5. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - Cooking engagement rate (how often they make recipes)
   - Recipe satisfaction (remake rate)
   - Rating generosity and distribution
   - Exploration tendency

### AI Integration Features
1. **Prompt Suggestions**
   - Auto-generated insights for ChatGPT prompts
   - User-specific preferences in natural language
   - Confidence scoring for recommendations

2. **Personalization Strength**
   - 0-1 scale based on rating volume and diversity
   - Recommendation confidence levels (high/medium/low)

3. **AI-Ready Data Format**
   - Structured data optimized for prompt inclusion
   - Key preferences summarized for token efficiency

## üìä Data Analysis Examples

### Sample Preference Profile:
```json
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "total_ratings": 25,
  "average_rating": 4.2,
  "cuisine_preferences": {
    "top_cuisines": ["Italian", "Mexican", "Mediterranean"],
    "diversity_score": 8
  },
  "complexity_preferences": {
    "preferred_difficulty": 3,
    "complexity_tolerance": 2.5
  },
  "time_preferences": {
    "preferred_time_range": "medium",
    "time_bucket_preferences": {
      "quick": 3.8,
      "medium": 4.5,
      "long": 3.2
    }
  },
  "aspect_preferences": {
    "most_important_aspects": ["taste", "ease_of_preparation", "ingredient_availability"]
  }
}
```

### Sample AI Prompt Suggestions:
- "User particularly enjoys Italian cuisine"
- "User prefers moderate cooking times (30-60 minutes)"
- "User actively cooks and tries new recipes"
- "User values taste and ease of preparation most"

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Queries
- **Optimized Queries**: Efficient aggregation of rating data
- **Isolated Connections**: Separate from main application pool
- **Statistical Functions**: Built-in preference calculation

### Authentication & Security
- **User-scoped Access**: Users can only see their own analytics
- **Admin Override**: Admin users can access any user's data
- **Token-based Auth**: Reuses rating system authentication

### Performance Considerations
- **Caching Opportunities**: Results can be cached for performance
- **Incremental Updates**: Can be triggered when new ratings are added
- **Lightweight Queries**: Optimized for minimal database load

## üéØ Next Steps for AI Integration

### Phase 1: Prompt Integration ‚úÖ READY
- Include user preferences in ChatGPT prompts
- Use AI-ready data format in menu generation
- Implement confidence-based personalization

### Phase 2: Feedback Loop (Next)
- Track which AI recommendations get rated highly
- Adjust recommendation weights based on success
- Implement continuous learning cycle

### Phase 3: Advanced ML (Future)
- Custom recommendation models
- Collaborative filtering
- Deep learning for preference prediction

## üìà Usage Analytics

The system tracks:
- **Platform Trends**: Popular cuisines and recipes
- **User Engagement**: Rating frequency and patterns
- **Recipe Performance**: Which recipes get highest ratings
- **Preference Evolution**: How user tastes change over time

## üöÄ Integration Points
