# Simplified Database Connection Fix

We've created a simplified database connection handling approach to address the issues with connection pooling and autocommit settings.

## Overview of the Fix

1. **Simplified Connection Pool**:
   - Switched from specialized pools to a single, simpler connection pool
   - Reduced complexity in connection management
   - Removed parameters that were causing compatibility issues

2. **Transaction Safety**:
   - Added automatic rollback when getting connections to ensure clean state
   - Set autocommit only after ensuring connection is in a clean state
   - Improved error handling and logging

3. **Application Lifecycle Management**:
   - Added proper initialization in application startup
   - Added connection cleanup on application shutdown
   - Added pool status logging

## Files Changed

1. **Created db_simplified.py**: A simpler, more robust implementation
2. **Updated auth.py**: To use the simplified database module
3. **Updated main.py**: To initialize and clean up connections properly

## Implementation Steps for Production

1. **Copy the Simplified DB File**:
   ```bash
   # On the production server
   cp /mnt/d/smart_meal_planner_multi/apps/smart-meal-planner-backend/app/db_simplified.py /path/to/app/db_simplified.py
   ```

2. **Update Auth Router**:
   ```bash
   # Edit the auth.py file to change the import
   sed -i 's/from ..db import/from ..db_simplified import/g' /path/to/app/routers/auth.py
   ```

3. **Update Main Application**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the updated main.py file
   cp /mnt/d/smart_meal_planner_multi/apps/smart-meal-planner-backend/app/main.py /path/to/app/main.py
   ```

4. **Restart the Application**:
   ```bash
   # Restart the application to apply changes
   # (This depends on your deployment method)
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Stability**: More robust connection handling prevents hanging issues
2. **Better Error Recovery**: Automatic rollback ensures connections are in a clean state
3. **Simplified Management**: Simpler code is easier to maintain and debug
4. **Better Logging**: Enhanced logging helps diagnose issues

## Verification

After implementing this fix, verify that:

1. Users can log in successfully
2. Database operations work correctly
3. Menu generation and shopping list access work concurrently
4. No more "set_session cannot be used inside a transaction" errors

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:

1. Restore the original db.py file
2. Update auth.py to use the original db module
3. Restart the application

## Future Considerations

Once this simplified approach is stable, you may want to:

1. Consider implementing more sophisticated connection pooling
2. Add more detailed monitoring and metrics
3. Further optimize connection usage patterns
