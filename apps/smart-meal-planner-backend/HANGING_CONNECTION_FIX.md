# Fix for Hanging Database Connections

## Issues Identified

1. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Connections may not be properly returned to the pool
2. **Transaction State Issues**: Connections returned to the pool may be in an uncertain state
3. **Timeout Issues**: Long-running queries without timeouts can block other operations

## Solution Implemented

We've made several improvements to handle these issues:

### 1. Enhanced Connection Management

- **Improved Connection Acquisition**:
  - Added retry logic for getting connections (up to 3 attempts)
  - Added exponential backoff between retries
  - Improved error logging during connection acquisition

- **Connection Pool Monitoring and Reset**:
  - Added `reset_pool_if_needed` function to detect and reset troubled pools
  - Added automatic periodic checking of pool health (1% chance per connection request)
  - Force pool reset after repeated connection failures

- **Better Error Handling**:
  - Added try/except blocks around statement timeout settings
  - Added transaction rollback before setting autocommit
  - Improved logging with timestamps and connection counts

### 2. Timeout Improvements

- **Reduced Statement Timeout**:
  - Changed from 30 seconds to 10 seconds to detect hanging operations faster
  - Added error handling around timeout setting to prevent failures

- **Enhanced Logging**:
  - Added timestamp to connection pool statistics
  - Added warning when pools are nearing capacity
  - Added detailed retry logging

## Code Changes

```python
# Function to reset connection pools when needed
def reset_pool_if_needed(pool_type='general'):
    """Reset a connection pool if it seems to be having issues"""
    pool_obj = get_pool_by_type(pool_type)
    stats = _connection_stats.get(pool_type, _connection_stats['general'])
    
    # Check if pool needs reset (high active connections)
    if pool_obj and stats['active_connections'] > 0.7 * pool_obj._maxconn:
        logger.warning(f"⚠️ {pool_type.upper()} pool may have connection leaks. Attempting reset.")
        try:
            # Close all connections
            pool_obj.closeall()
            
            # Reset stats
            with _stats_lock:
                stats['active_connections'] = 0
                stats['last_reset'] = time.time()
                
            logger.info(f"✅ Successfully reset {pool_type.upper()} connection pool")
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"❌ Failed to reset {pool_type.upper()} connection pool: {str(e)}")
            return False
    return False
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Monitor Connection Pool Statistics**:
   - Watch for warnings about nearing capacity
   - Check if reset operations are occurring
   - Verify active connection counts decrease after operations

2. **Test Concurrent Operations**:
   - Generate menus while accessing shopping lists
   - Login multiple users simultaneously
   - Browse recipes during menu generation

3. **Check for Timeouts**:
   - Verify that operations don't hang indefinitely
   - Confirm 10-second statement timeouts are being applied

## Expected Outcomes

1. **No More Hanging**: Operations should either complete or timeout within 10 seconds
2. **Better Resilience**: Connection failures should automatically retry
3. **Self-Healing**: Problematic connection pools should automatically reset
4. **Improved Visibility**: Enhanced logging should help diagnose future issues
