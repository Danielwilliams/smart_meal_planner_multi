# Instacart Mock Data Removal

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to remove mock data from the Instacart API integration endpoints. Per project requirements, all mock data responses have been replaced with proper error responses that clearly indicate the issue and provide actionable information to the user.

## Changes Made

### 1. `/instacart/retailers` Endpoint
- Removed mock retailer data that was previously returned when the API key was missing or invalid
- Now returns a structured error response with:
  - Clear error message
  - Error status
  - Details about the missing API key
  - Type of error

### 2. `/instacart/retailers/{retailer_id}/products/search` Endpoint
- Removed mock product data that was previously returned when:
  - API key was missing
  - API request failed
  - General errors occurred
- Now returns structured error responses that include:
  - Query information (retailer_id, search query, limit)
  - Error type and message
  - Detailed error information

### 3. `/instacart/retailers/nearby` Endpoint
- Removed all mock proximity data generation
- Now explicitly states that the Instacart API does not support location-based filtering
- Returns a "not_implemented" status with clear explanation and recommendations

### 4. Debug and Testing Endpoints
- Removed mock data from all debug endpoints:
  - `/instacart/mock-retailers`
  - `/instacart/mock-retailers/nearby`
  - `/instacart/mock-products/search`
  - `/instacart/debug/retailers/nearby`
- Changed these endpoints to return error responses explaining that mock data is no longer supported
- Provided information about the recommended real endpoints to use instead

## Error Response Format
All error responses now follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": "Clear error message",
  "status": "error",  // or "not_implemented" when appropriate
  "details": {
    "type": "ErrorType",
    "message": "Detailed error message"
  },
  // Additional context-specific information
}
```

## Benefits of These Changes
1. **Transparency**: The frontend now receives clear information about what's wrong
2. **Consistency**: All error responses follow the same format, making them easier to handle
3. **Actionability**: Error responses include specific information about what needs to be fixed
4. **Meets Requirements**: Completely removes all mock data as requested

## Next Steps
1. Update the frontend to properly handle these error responses
2. Ensure proper API key configuration in production environment
3. Consider implementing better location-based filtering when/if the Instacart API adds support for it
