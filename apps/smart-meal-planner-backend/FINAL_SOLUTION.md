# FINAL DATABASE CONNECTION FIX

## Solution Approach

After multiple attempts, we've implemented a radically simplified solution that:

1. Uses a single `db.py` file with minimal complexity
2. Includes ALL required database functions from the original db.py
3. Sets a 10-second statement timeout to prevent hanging queries
4. Properly handles connection cleanup in all scenarios

## What Changed

1. **Complete Rewrite of db.py**:
   - Ultra-simplified connection handling
   - Removed all complex features and monitoring
   - Added statement timeout to prevent hanging
   - Maintained backward compatibility with all parameters
   - Included ALL necessary database helper functions

2. **Updated All Key Router Files**:
   - menu.py
   - auth.py
   - grocery_list.py
   - meal_grocery_list.py
   - subscriptions.py
   - auth_utils.py
   - auth_middleware.py

3. **Removed Alternative DB Modules**:
   - Removed db_simplified.py
   - Removed db_enhanced_actual.py
   - Removed db_super_simple.py

## Technical Implementation

1. **Single Connection Pool**:
   - One ThreadedConnectionPool with 5-30 connections
   - No specialized pools for different operation types
   - pool_type parameter accepted but ignored

2. **Statement Timeout**:
   - 10-second timeout for all queries
   - Set via "SET statement_timeout = 10000"
   - Prevents queries from hanging indefinitely

3. **Transaction Management**:
   - Automatic rollback before using connections
   - Proper commit after write operations
   - Explicit transaction control

4. **All Required Helper Functions**:
   - track_recipe_interaction
   - is_recipe_saved
   - get_saved_recipe_id
   - save_recipe
   - unsave_recipe
   - get_user_saved_recipes
   - get_saved_recipe_by_id

## Deployment

1. Deploy these updated files:
   - `/app/db.py` - The core fix with all required functions
   - `/app/routers/menu.py`
   - `/app/routers/auth.py`
   - `/app/routers/grocery_list.py` 
   - `/app/routers/meal_grocery_list.py`
   - `/app/routers/subscriptions.py`
   - `/app/utils/auth_utils.py`
   - `/app/utils/auth_middleware.py`

2. Ensure you've removed all other alternative DB modules:
   - `/app/db_simplified.py`
   - `/app/db_enhanced_actual.py`
   - `/app/db_super_simple.py`

3. Restart the application:
   ```
   # Railway
   railway up
   
   # Heroku
   heroku restart -a your-app-name
   ```

## Verification

After deploying:

1. Check the application logs for:
   ```
   INFO:app.db:Database connection pool created with 5-30 connections
   ```

2. Verify that the application loads without errors

3. Test all key database operations:
   - Logging in
   - Viewing saved recipes
   - Generating menus
   - Viewing shopping lists

## Additional Diagnostics

If database issues persist:

1. **Identify exact hanging endpoints**:
   - Try accessing each endpoint directly via API calls
   - Note which specific operations are hanging

2. **Check logs for any warning messages**:
   - Look for statement timeout errors
   - Check for connection pool errors

3. **Test connection pooling**:
   - Check if connections are being returned to the pool
   - Monitor number of active connections

4. **Consider alternative query optimizations**:
   - Review specific SQL queries that might be hanging
   - Look for missing indexes or inefficient queries

## Manual Reset

You can reset all database connections using:
```
POST /admin/reset-connections
```

This will force-close all connections and recreate the pool if necessary.
