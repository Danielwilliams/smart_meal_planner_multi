# Smart Meal Planner - AI Shopping List Fixes

This directory contains files with fixes for the AI Shopping List feature in the Smart Meal Planner application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **AI Shopping List snackbar notification looping** - The "AI shopping list ready!" notification was showing repeatedly rather than just once when the list was ready.
2. **Missing quantities on shopping list items** - Items in the AI-enhanced shopping list weren't displaying quantities.

## Fix Files

1. `fix_instructions.md` - Detailed instructions on what to change in the ShoppingListPage.jsx file
2. `api_service_fix.js` - Code to add to apiService.js to ensure quantities are processed properly
3. `shopping_list_fixes.js` - Full code blocks to fix both issues

## Implementation

The fixes involve:

1. Adding code to format all items to ensure they have quantity, unit, and display_name properties
2. Limiting the snackbar notification to only show on the first couple of status checks
3. Ensuring proper error handling is in place between status condition blocks
4. Adding item formatting logic in both the frontend component and API service

## Testing

After implementing these fixes:

1. Generate a new AI shopping list
2. Verify that quantities are showing on items in the list
3. Verify that the "AI shopping list ready!" notification only shows once when the list is ready

## Additional Notes

- The backend `/menu/{menu_id}/ai-shopping-list/status` endpoint has been updated to properly handle timeouts and ensure consistent response formats
- All items in the response now have consistent structure with name, quantity, unit, and display_name properties
- The UI will show a notification when AI processing completes
