# Final Fix for Instacart Integration

## The Solution

After investigating the issue, we've found that the core problem is that your frontend is trying to make direct requests to the Railway backend, which causes CORS issues. The solution is to use the Vercel proxy that's already configured in your `vercel.json` file.

## Steps to Fix

1. Replace your current `instacartBackendService.js` with the new version:

   ```bash
   cd apps/smart-meal-planner-web/src/services
   cp NEW_instacartBackendService.js instacartBackendService.js
   ```

   The key differences in the new file are:
   
   - Uses a blank `BASE_URL` to ensure all requests go through your frontend domain
   - Changes all API paths to use `/api/instacart/...` instead of `/instacart/...`
   - These paths will be caught by your Vercel proxy configuration

2. Push these changes to your repository:

   ```bash
   git add apps/smart-meal-planner-web/src/services/instacartBackendService.js
   git commit -m "Fix Instacart integration with proper proxy configuration"
   git push
   ```

3. Make sure your Railway backend has the properly formatted environment variable:

   ```
   INSTACARTAPI_DEV=InstacartAPI YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
   ```

That's it! The changes are minimal but should fix the issue.

## Why This Works

1. Your `vercel.json` file already has a proxy setup:

   ```json
   {
     "src": "/api/instacart/(.*)",
     "dest": "https://smartmealplannermulti-development.up.railway.app/instacart/$1"
   }
   ```

2. With these changes, your frontend will send requests to `/api/instacart/...` on your own domain
3. Vercel will proxy these requests to your Railway backend
4. Since the requests are being proxied through your own domain, there are no CORS issues

This approach follows the same pattern used by your working Kroger integration, but uses the proper URL format for the Instacart proxy.

## If You Continue to Have Issues

If you still encounter problems after deploying these changes:

1. Check your Railway logs for any backend errors
2. Verify that your INSTACARTAPI_DEV environment variable is set correctly
3. Test with a direct API tool like Postman to see if the backend endpoints work
