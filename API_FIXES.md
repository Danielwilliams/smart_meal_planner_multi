# Flutter App API Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve API-related errors in the Smart Meal Planner mobile app.

## 1. Fixed Duplicate Method Issue

The error was caused by having two methods with the same name but different signatures:

```
Error: 'getOrganizationClients' is already declared in this scope.
```

### Solution:

1. Renamed the second implementation to avoid conflicts:
   ```dart
   // Old
   static Future<List<dynamic>> getOrganizationClients(String authToken) async { ... }
   
   // New
   static Future<List<dynamic>> getOrganizationClientsList(String authToken) async { ... }
   ```

2. Updated the OrganizationClientService to use the renamed method:
   ```dart
   final clientsData = await ApiService.getOrganizationClientsList(authToken);
   ```

## 2. Fixed Private Method Access Issues

The error was caused by trying to access private methods from outside the ApiService class:

```
Error: Member not found: 'ApiService._get'.
Error: Member not found: 'ApiService._toStringDynamicMap'.
Error: Member not found: 'ApiService._post'.
```

### Solution:

Rewrote the methods in OrganizationClientService to use the http package directly:

```dart
// Old
final result = await ApiService._get("/subscriptions/user-management/org/clients/$clientId", authToken);
return ClientUser.fromJson(ApiService._toStringDynamicMap(result));

// New
final clientUrl = Uri.parse("${ApiService.baseUrl}/subscriptions/user-management/org/clients/$clientId");
final headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer $authToken", "Content-Type": "application/json"};
final response = await http.get(clientUrl, headers: headers);

if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  final data = json.decode(response.body);
  return ClientUser.fromJson(data);
}
```

This approach:
1. Uses the public `baseUrl` from ApiService
2. Creates HTTP requests directly using the http package
3. Parses the responses without relying on private methods

## 3. Added Missing Imports

Added the necessary imports to support the new implementation:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
```

## Summary of Files Modified

1. **api_service.dart**
   - Renamed the duplicate method to `getOrganizationClientsList`

2. **organization_client_service.dart**
   - Updated to use the renamed method
   - Replaced private method calls with direct HTTP requests
   - Added missing imports

3. **organization_screen.dart**
   - Added a comment to clarify which version of the method is being used

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test the client list retrieval functionality
2. Verify client management operations work correctly
3. Check that organization screens load properly

## Future Improvements

1. Consider making the private API methods in ApiService public, with appropriate documentation
2. Implement a more structured approach to API versioning and endpoint management
3. Add proper error handling and retry logic for all API calls
