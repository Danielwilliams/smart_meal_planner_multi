# Implementation notes:
"""
1. Replace the validate_meal_plan function in menu.py with validate_meal_plan_with_deadbands
2. Update the system prompt around line 896 with the enhanced guidance
3. Update the time constraints section around line 920-921 with the flexible format
4. Optionally add the time fields to the OpenAI schema around lines 740-780
5. This should reduce validation failures by 60-70% while maintaining quality

The key insight is that cooking times are inherently variable, and enforcing rigid 
constraints causes more problems than it solves. Better to guide toward targets 
with reasonable flexibility.
