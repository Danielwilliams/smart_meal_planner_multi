# Database Connection Optimization Plan
## Smart Meal Planner Multi-User Application

### Executive Summary

The current database connection system successfully handles menu generation concurrency but experiences connection pool conflicts during high-load scenarios. This plan outlines a phased approach to optimize the system while maintaining the crucial concurrency benefits for menu generation.

---

## Current System Analysis

### ✅ Strengths
- **Background Job System**: Prevents menu generation from blocking other users
- **Thread-Local Connection Caching**: Reduces connection overhead per thread
- **Connection Pool with Fallback**: 10-100 connection pool with direct connection fallback
- **Semaphore Concurrency Control**: Limits concurrent generations (10 max)
- **Connection Age Tracking**: 5-minute stale connection detection
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Multiple fallback strategies

### ❌ Current Issues
- **Race Conditions**: Thread-local connection management conflicts
- **Connection Ownership Conflicts**: Between pool and thread-local storage
- **Autocommit State Management**: Causing rollback errors on committed transactions
- **Thread-Local Cleanup Timing**: Issues during high concurrency
- **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: 62/62 active connections causing 500 errors

---

## Phase 1: Immediate Stability (Week 1)

### Priority: Rating System Isolation

**Goal**: Get rating system working without disrupting existing concurrency management.

#### 1.1 Isolated Rating Connection Pool
```python
# Create dedicated pool for rating operations
rating_pool = psycopg2.pool.ThreadedConnectionPool(
    minconn=2,
    maxconn=8,  # Small pool for rating operations only
    application_name="rating_service",
    **db_config
)
```

#### 1.2 Rating-Specific Connection Context
```python
@contextmanager
def get_rating_connection():
    """Dedicated connection manager for rating operations only"""
    conn = None
    try:
        conn = rating_pool.getconn()
        conn.autocommit = True
        yield conn
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Rating connection error: {e}")
        raise
    finally:
        if conn:
            rating_pool.putconn(conn)
```

#### 1.3 Health Check Endpoints
```python
@router.get("/health/rating-system")
async def rating_system_health():
    return {
        "rating_pool_active": rating_pool.closed == 0,
        "rating_pool_connections": {
            "available": len(rating_pool._available),
            "used": len(rating_pool._used)
        }
    }
```

**Success Criteria**: Rating system works without 500 errors, doesn't interfere with menu generation.

---

## Phase 2: Connection Pool Optimization (Week 2-3)

### Priority: Resolve pool exhaustion and race conditions

#### 2.1 Pool Segmentation Strategy
```python
# Separate pools by operation type and duration
connection_pools = {
    "fast": ThreadedConnectionPool(5, 15),     # Auth, preferences, quick reads
    "medium": ThreadedConnectionPool(3, 10),   # Recipe operations, ratings
    "heavy": ThreadedConnectionPool(2, 8),     # Menu generation, bulk operations
    "background": ThreadedConnectionPool(1, 5) # Long-running background jobs
}
```

#### 2.2 Request-Scoped Connection Management
```python
class RequestConnectionManager:
    """Per-request connection management to avoid thread-local conflicts"""
    
    def __init__(self, pool_type="fast"):
        self.pool = connection_pools[pool_type]
        self.connection = None
        self.request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    
    def __enter__(self):
        self.connection = self.pool.getconn()
        logger.debug(f"Connection acquired for request {self.request_id}")
        return self.connection
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if self.connection:
            self.pool.putconn(self.connection)
            logger.debug(f"Connection returned for request {self.request_id}")
```

#### 2.3 Connection Health Monitoring
```python
async def monitor_connection_health():
    """Background task to monitor and clean stale connections"""
    while True:
        try:
            for pool_name, pool in connection_pools.items():
                # Check pool health
                if pool.closed != 0:
                    logger.error(f"Pool {pool_name} is closed, recreating...")
                    connection_pools[pool_name] = recreate_pool(pool_name)
                
                # Log pool statistics
                logger.info(f"Pool {pool_name}: available={len(pool._available)}, used={len(pool._used)}")
                
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Connection health check failed: {e}")
        
        await asyncio.sleep(30)  # Check every 30 seconds
```

**Success Criteria**: Pool exhaustion eliminated, connection conflicts reduced by 90%.

---

## Phase 3: Transaction Management Refinement (Week 3-4)

### Priority: Eliminate autocommit conflicts and rollback errors

#### 3.1 Operation-Specific Transaction Strategies
```python
class TransactionStrategy:
    """Define transaction handling per operation type"""
    
    STRATEGIES = {
        "read_only": {"autocommit": True, "isolation": "READ_COMMITTED"},
        "simple_write": {"autocommit": True, "isolation": "READ_COMMITTED"},
        "complex_write": {"autocommit": False, "isolation": "READ_COMMITTED"},
        "menu_generation": {"autocommit": False, "isolation": "SERIALIZABLE"}
    }
    
    @classmethod
    def get_connection(cls, strategy_name: str, pool_type: str = "medium"):
        pool = connection_pools[pool_type]
        conn = pool.getconn()
        
        strategy = cls.STRATEGIES[strategy_name]
        conn.autocommit = strategy["autocommit"]
        conn.set_isolation_level(strategy["isolation"])
        
        return conn
```

#### 3.2 Context Manager Improvements
```python
@contextmanager
def get_optimized_cursor(strategy: str = "read_only", pool_type: str = "fast"):
    """Optimized cursor with proper transaction handling"""
    conn = None
    cursor = None
    
    try:
        conn = TransactionStrategy.get_connection(strategy, pool_type)
        cursor = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=RealDictCursor)
        
        # Set statement timeout based on operation type
        timeout = {"read_only": 10000, "simple_write": 15000, "complex_write": 30000, "menu_generation": 120000}
        cursor.execute(f"SET statement_timeout = {timeout.get(strategy, 15000)}")
        
        yield cursor, conn
        
        # Only commit if not autocommit
        if not conn.autocommit:
            conn.commit()
            
    except Exception as e:
        if conn and not conn.autocommit:
            try:
                conn.rollback()
            except Exception as rb_e:
                logger.error(f"Rollback failed: {rb_e}")
        raise
    finally:
        if cursor:
            cursor.close()
        if conn:
            connection_pools[pool_type].putconn(conn)
```

**Success Criteria**: Autocommit errors eliminated, transaction rollback errors reduced by 95%.

## Phase 4: Advanced Concurrency Optimization (Week 4-5)

### Priority: Enhance performance and reliability under load

#### 4.1 Async Connection Queue System
```python
class AsyncConnectionQueue:
    """Queue-based connection management for high-throughput operations"""
    
    def __init__(self, pool_name: str, max_queue_size: int = 100):
        self.pool = connection_pools[pool_name]
        self.queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=max_queue_size)
        self.active_operations = 0
        
    async def execute_operation(self, operation_func, *args, **kwargs):
        """Execute database operation through queue"""
        if self.active_operations >= self.queue.maxsize:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail="System overloaded, try again later")
        
        self.active_operations += 1
        try:
            await self.queue.put((operation_func, args, kwargs))
            return await self._process_queue_item()
        finally:
            self.active_operations -= 1
    
    async def _process_queue_item(self):
        operation_func, args, kwargs = await self.queue.get()
        
        conn = self.pool.getconn()
        try:
            return await operation_func(conn, *args, **kwargs)
        finally:
            self.pool.putconn(conn)
            self.queue.task_done()
```

#### 4.2 Circuit Breaker Pattern
```python
class DatabaseCircuitBreaker:
    """Circuit breaker for database operations"""
    
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold: int = 5, reset_timeout: int = 60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.reset_timeout = reset_timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
    
    async def call(self, operation):
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.reset_timeout:
                self.state = "HALF_OPEN"
            else:
                raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail="Database circuit breaker is OPEN")
        
        try:
            result = await operation()
            if self.state == "HALF_OPEN":
                self.state = "CLOSED"
                self.failure_count = 0
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.failure_count += 1
            self.last_failure_time = time.time()
            
            if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
                self.state = "OPEN"
            
            raise
```

#### 4.3 Smart Connection Load Balancing
```python
class SmartConnectionBalancer:
    """Intelligent connection distribution across pools"""
    
    def get_optimal_pool(self, operation_type: str, current_load: dict):
        """Select the best pool based on current load and operation type"""
        
        # Priority mapping
        pool_preferences = {
            "rating": ["medium", "fast"],
            "auth": ["fast", "medium"], 
            "menu_generation": ["heavy", "background"],
            "recipe_lookup": ["fast", "medium"]
        }
        
        for pool_name in pool_preferences.get(operation_type, ["medium"]):
            pool = connection_pools[pool_name]
            availability = len(pool._available) / (len(pool._available) + len(pool._used))
            
            if availability > 0.3:  # 30% availability threshold
                return pool_name
        
        # Fallback to least loaded pool
        return min(connection_pools.keys(), 
                  key=lambda p: len(connection_pools[p]._used))
```

**Success Criteria**: 99.9% uptime during peak load, sub-100ms response times for rating operations.

                if latencies
            }
        }
```

#### 5.2 Automated Performance Alerts
```python

    """Automated alerting for performance issues"""
    
    alert_thresholds = {
        "pool_utilization": 0.8,      # 80% pool utilization

        # Check pool utilization
        for pool_name, stats in perf_summary["pool_stats"].items():
            if stats["utilization"] > self.alert_thresholds["pool_utilization"]:
                alerts.append(f"HIGH_POOL_UTILIZATION: {pool_name} at {stats['utilization']:.1%}")
        
        # Check latencies
        rating_p95 = perf_summary["latency_percentiles"].get("rating", {}).get("p95", 0)
        if rating_p95 > self.alert_thresholds["rating_latency_p95"]:
            alerts.append(f"HIGH_RATING_LATENCY: P95 = {rating_p95:.1f}ms")
        
        if alerts:
            await self.send_alerts(alerts)
    
    async def send_alerts(self, alerts: List[str]):
        # Implementation for sending alerts (Slack, email, etc.)
        logger.critical(f"PERFORMANCE ALERTS: {'; '.join(alerts)}")
