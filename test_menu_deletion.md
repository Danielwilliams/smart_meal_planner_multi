# Menu Deletion Implementation Test Plan

## Backend Implementation ✅
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /menu/{menu_id}`
- **Location**: `apps/smart-meal-planner-backend/app/routers/menu.py` (lines 3560-3677)
- **Permissions**: 
  - Individual users can delete their own menus
  - Organization owners can delete menus shared with their org or created for their clients
- **Safe Deletion**: Uses database transactions with proper cascade deletion order:
  1. Delete from `shared_menus` table
  2. Delete from `saved_recipes` table  
  3. Delete from `menus` table

## Frontend Implementation ✅
- **UI**: Delete button added to menu history dropdown in `MenuDisplayPage.jsx`
- **API Service**: `deleteMenu(menuId)` function added to `apiService.js`
- **User Experience**:
  - Red delete icon next to edit icon for each menu
  - Confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Success message after deletion
  - Auto-refresh of menu history
  - Fallback to latest menu if deleted menu was currently selected

## Database Relationships Handled ✅
- `shared_menus.menu_id` → `menus.id`
- `saved_recipes.menu_id` → `menus.id`

## Security Considerations ✅
- Proper authentication required (Bearer token)
- Permission checks prevent unauthorized deletions
- Transaction rollback on any failure
- Audit logging of deletion events

## Test Cases to Verify
1. **Individual User**: Can delete their own menu
2. **Organization Owner**: Can delete organization menus and client menus
3. **Organization Member**: Cannot delete menus they don't own
4. **Cascade Deletion**: Verify related records are properly removed
5. **UI Updates**: Menu list refreshes after deletion
6. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed deletions

## Implementation Complete
The menu deletion feature has been successfully implemented with:
- Safe database operations with transaction support
- Proper permission controls for multi-tenant security  
- User-friendly frontend interface with confirmation dialogs
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
