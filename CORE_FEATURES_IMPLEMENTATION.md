# Core Features Implementation

Based on the migration plan, we've successfully implemented the following core features from the web app into the mobile app:

## 1. Subscription System Integration

We've added the following components:

1. **Subscription Model** (`lib/models/subscription_model.dart`)
   - Defines the structure for subscription data
   - Provides methods for parsing API responses
   - Includes a default "free" subscription factory

2. **Subscription Provider** (`lib/Providers/subscription_provider.dart`)
   - Manages subscription state using ChangeNotifier
   - Handles caching subscription status in SharedPreferences
   - Provides methods for checking subscription status

3. **Subscription API Methods** (`lib/services/api_service.dart`)
   - Added `getUserSubscription` method to fetch subscription status
   - Handles multiple API endpoints for better compatibility
   - Includes fallbacks for when the API is unavailable

4. **Subscription Route Wrapper** (`lib/components/subscription_route_wrapper.dart`)
   - Wraps components to enforce subscription access
   - Shows appropriate UI when subscription is required
   - Grants access to authenticated users

5. **Subscription Page** (`lib/Screens/subscription_page.dart`)
   - Displays available subscription plans
   - Shows current subscription status
   - Provides UI for upgrading/managing subscriptions

## 2. User Management System

We've added the following components:

1. **User Management Models** (`lib/models/user_management_model.dart`)
   - Defines `UserProfile` and `ClientUser` classes
   - Includes methods for parsing API responses
   - Handles various data formats for compatibility

2. **User Management API Methods** (`lib/services/api_service.dart`)
   - Added methods for getting, adding, and removing organization clients
   - Handles multiple API endpoints for better compatibility
   - Provides appropriate error handling

3. **Organization Client Service** (`lib/services/organization_client_service.dart`)
   - Provides a clean interface for client management operations
   - Abstracts away API complexity
   - Includes methods for detailed client operations

4. **Organization Clients Screen** (`lib/Screens/organization_clients_screen.dart`)
   - UI for viewing and managing organization clients
   - Includes form for adding new clients
   - Provides functionality for removing clients

5. **Organization Screen Update**
   - Added button to navigate to the client management screen
   - Integrated with existing organization functionality

## Integration with Main App

We've updated the following files to integrate these features:

1. **Main App** (`lib/main.dart`)
   - Added subscription provider to the provider list
   - Registered subscription page in the app routes
   - Set up proper imports for new components

2. **Organization Screen** (`lib/Screens/organization_screen.dart`)
   - Added navigation to the new clients management screen
   - Integrated with existing organization tabs

## Next Steps

To complete the core features implementation, we should:

1. **Test the Implementation**
   - Verify subscription checks work correctly
   - Test client management functionality with real API endpoints
   - Check error handling and edge cases

2. **Refine the UI**
   - Ensure consistent styling across components
   - Add animations for better user experience
   - Optimize layouts for different screen sizes

3. **Extend Functionality**
   - Add client detail screen
   - Implement client preferences management
   - Add client menu generation features

4. **Documentation**
   - Document the new features for developers
   - Create user guides for organization administrators
   - Add inline code comments for better maintainability
